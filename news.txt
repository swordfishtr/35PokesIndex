title: News Test

I added a news view to the extension
which will hold the latest message from
one of the maintainers. Its button is
yellow when there are unread news.

This will be used to communicate only
the most urgent information - major or
breaking updates, and how to proceed -
which is not suitable in #announcements
where it might be overlooked or fail to
reach its audience entirely.
